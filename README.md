# PepperPostCatastrophe
This is an assignment for the course Human Computer Interaction (COMP4461) at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

This is an application for the semi-humanoid robot Pepper made by SoftBank Robotics.
The application attempts to turn Pepper into a service robot that helps people in the aftermath of catastrophic events.
At the time of development we had just been trapped inside the super typhoon Mangkhut that killed 134 people and caused billions of dollars of damages across south east asia.
We tried to find ways a semi humanoid robot could help society in such an event and implemented a small prototype of this.
